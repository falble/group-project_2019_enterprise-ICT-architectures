Group Project for the Enterprise ICT Architecture. The goal was trying to solve a given problem implementing a new solution based on an ICT architecture.

# Executive Summary

People and ecosystems require an adequate quality as well as a steady equilibrium of the environment that surrounds them in order to live and prosper. 
Historically, many ecosystems on Earth have suffered severely because of human activities and have changed drastically, or even permanently, because of poor pollution management 
and failures to understand the severity of the problem, also due to the lack of information, by policymakers. Luckily, nowadays, thanks to the huge progress that have been made 
both in the field of database management systems as well as in the field of IoT systems, policymakers and environmental protection agency have a powerful tool to measure 
constantly hundreds of parameters and act accordingly.

The Elk River is a large geographical area in the United States, known for its distinctive flora and fauna. This report focuses on describing the problems that afflict this 
geographical area, with a special focus on the three most important elements of a riverside environment: water, air and soil (with a focus on noise levels). Following these 
considerations, a proposal for an information system (IS) that deploys different type of sensors has been presented. The data will be gathered by the sensors and stored in a 
database, which can be accessed by the policy makers in order to help them make informed decisions about corrective measures that might be needed for the area.
